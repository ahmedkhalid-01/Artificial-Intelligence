Detecting and monitoring deforestation accurately is essential for implementing effective conservation strategies. k-means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, can be utilized to analyze satellite imagery and detect deforestation patterns. This document outlines a set of tasks for using k-means and k-mediods clustering to detect deforestation in the Amazon rainforest**."
